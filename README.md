# Face-Mask-Detection-using-YOLOv5

About

Masks are essential for protecting individuals against respiratory diseases like COVID-19. This project focuses on creating a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly. The dataset used contains 853 images with bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format, divided into three classes: "With mask," "Without mask," and "Mask worn incorrectly." We'll use the YOLOv5 algorithm to achieve this.

Project Structure

Download YOLO Algorithm Files: In this section, you will find instructions and resources for downloading the YOLOv5 algorithm files.

Annotation Handling: We provide scripts to read and handle the annotations, allowing you to prepare the dataset for training and evaluation.

Data Split: Learn how to split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A good data split is essential for model training and evaluation.

Model Configuration: Configure your YOLOv5 model for the specific task of mask detection. You can adjust hyperparameters and model architecture according to your requirements.

Model Training: Details on how to train your YOLOv5 model using the prepared dataset. We provide guidelines for choosing the number of epochs, batch sizes, and more.

Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, assess its performance on a test set. Understand metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy for each class.
